    <h1>A step-by-step walk through of your first HTML page</h1>

        HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language.Basically, it&apos;s the
        <q>code</q> behind every webpage &ndash; even this one. If you&apos;;re
        just beginning to learn HTML, let us tell you that it&apos;s a fairly
        easy task. HTML, without styling, can&apos;t do anything more than
        setting a layout, drawing a table, or creating frames &ndash; but it is
        handy as it helps you structure the content correctly, which is
        important when you sit down to add style to your HTML.

      However simple this might seem, it is a mighty useful tool when it comes
      to full-fledged web development. Various tools easily eliminate the HTML
      coding from your work process &dash; but if you want to be in full control
      of your web-page, you&apos;ll need to have some command over HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this article, we aim to give you the essential HTML building
      blocks that&apos;ll help you get up and running. Reading this, you&apos;ll
      be able to understand an HTML source code and even modify it for your own
      good!
    </p>

    <h2>Step One - TAGS</h2>
    <div>
      <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001485.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
      Tags are what you&apos;ll see the most when you look at any HTML source
      code. A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML
      document. Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by
      them.
    </p>

    Let&apos;s look at two types of tags:
    <ol>
      <li>&lt;tag-example-1&gt;I need a closign tag&lt;tag-example-1&gt;</li>
      <li>&lt;tag-example-2/&gt;I don't need a cloding tag.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags. The first one
      is called the opening tag and the second one is called the closing tag.
      Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very
      commonly used examples of such tags are &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;,
      &lt;body&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second example tags about loner tags &ndash; as in, they don&apos;t
      need a closing tag to function. Although it&apos;s not required, these
      type of tags are often written as &lt;tag/&gt; to make the debugging of
      code easier. Common examples of such tags are &lt;hr/&gt; &ndash; used for
      horizontal line, <br> &ndash; to break the line, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Step Two &ndash; HTML, HEAD, and BODY: The three pillars of your document</h2>
    <div>
      <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001488.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p>
      These tags are essential for any HTML document. They parcel out the
      significant parts of your HTML code.</p>
      <ul>
      <li> &lt;BODY&gt; &lt;/BODY&gt; is placed
      below your &lt;HEAD&gt; tag, and everything that you want to be displayed
      on your screen comes under this tag. Text, images, links, and pretty much
      anything you can see in your browser live inside this tag.</li>
      <li> &lt;HTML&gt;
      &lt;/HTML&gt; wraps your entire code. Everything else in your HTML
      document needs to come inside these tags.</li>
      <li> &lt;HEAD&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt;
      includes things like title, styles, and scripts. Head is usually present
      at the top (hah!), just inside the &lt;/HTML&gt; tag.</li>
    </ul>
      
      
 <h2>Step three &ndash; A few tags that&apos;ll make your page pretty</h2>
       <p>Now that you know how to
      set up the skeleton of your document, let&apos;s proceed with the things
      that will go inside your &lt;BODY&gt; tag and do some magic!</p>
      <p> Some basic
      text formatting tags:</p> 
      <ul>
      <li>&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; makes your text look bold</li>
     <li> &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt; makes you write in cursive</li>
     <li> &lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;
      underlines what you just wrote</li></ul>
      <p> For example, this piece of code</p>
      <hr>
      &lt;html&gt; <br>&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;<br> &lt;body&gt;<br> &lt;i&gt; I am
      italics! &lt;/i&gt; <br> &lt;b&gt; I am bold! &lt;/b&gt;
      <br> &lt;u&gt; And me, well, I'm underlined! &lt;/u&gt; <br>
      &lt;/body&gt;<br> &lt;/html&gt; 
      <hr>
      <p>Should produce something like this on your
      browser: Don&apos;t fret too much about the &lt;br&gt;. It&apos;s just
      for breaking the line so that you can start from the next line. Enter key
      does little when it comes to changing lines in your HTML document.</p>
      <div>
        <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001490.png" />
      </div>
     <h2> Tags to
      help you structure your content:</h2>
      <ul>
      <li> &lt;br&gt; breaks the line, making you
      continue to the next line</li>
      <li> &lt;p&gt; stands for paragraph. It divides your
      content into paragraphs</li>
      <p> Note: you need to use these tags as space and
      enter keys do very little when it comes to formatting content inside an
      HTML document.</p> 
   <h2>Heading Tags:</h2>
  <p>  HTML provides you with six tags,

      from &lt;H1&gt; &lt;/H1&gt; to &lt;H6&gt; &lt;/H6&gt; to help you create
      different sized headers quickly.</p>
      <div>
        <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001487.png" />
      </div>
    <h2>Inserting an Image:</h2>
    <p All
      that&apos;s good, but what fun without images on the webpage? Don&apos;t
      worry, &lt;IMG/&gt; to the rescue! The image tag has a mandatory attribute
      called &lt;q&gt;source&lt;/q&gt;. Basically, it tells the browser where it
      should look for the image. The syntax goes something like:</p>
    </p> &lt; img src =
      <q>path_to_your_image</q> /&gt;</p>
      <p> Furthermore, it also has attributes like height
      and width that let you specify the height and width you want your image to
      take.</p>
      <h2>Lists:</h2>
      <p> HTML has two types of lists &ndash; ordered and
      unordered. Each item of your list has to be enclosed in a tag. The syntax
      for creating a list is fairly simple.</p>
      <p> Suppose you want to create a list
      like:</p>
      <ul>
     <li>  Item 1 </li>
     <li>  Item 2 </li>
     <li>  Item 3 </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following code will easily do the job for
      you:</p>
      <hr>
      &lt;ul&gt;<br> &lt;li&gt; Item 1 &lt;/li&gt;<br>  &lt;li&gt; Item 2
      &lt;/li&gt;<br>  &lt;li&gt; Item 3 &lt;/li&gt;<br>  &lt;/ul&gt;<br> 
      <hr>
    <p>  
      This, by the way,
      was an example of an unordered list. For an ordered list, all you need to
      do is replace &lt;ul&gt; with &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;/ul&gt; with &lt;/ol&gt;.</p>
     <p> Let&apos;s see what the following code does:</p>
     <hr>
      &lt;html&gt; <br> &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;<br>  &lt;body&gt;<br>  &lt;ul&gt;<br>  &lt;li&gt; I am unordered list's
      item 1! &lt;/li&gt;<br>  &lt;li&gt; I am unordered list's item 2! &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; I am unordered list's item 3! &lt;/li&gt;<br>  &lt;li&gt; I am
      unordered list's item 4! &lt;/li&gt;<br>  &lt;/ul&gt;<br>  &lt;ol&gt;<br>  &lt;li&gt; I
      am ordered list's item 1! &lt;/li&gt; <br> &lt;li&gt; I am ordered list's item
      2! &lt;/li&gt;<br>  &lt;li&gt; I am ordered list's item 3! &lt;/li&gt;<br> 
      &lt;li&gt; I am ordered list's item 4! &lt;/li&gt;<br>  &lt;/ol&gt;<br> 
      &lt;/body&gt; <br> &lt;/html&gt;<br> 
      <hr>
      <hr>
      <div>
        <img src=" https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001489.png" />
      </div>
     
    <p>  All of these tags, when arranged coherently,
      will provide you with a simple webpage consisting of images, headings, and
      lists. Further, there are various tags that HTML supports, and we
      thoroughly recommend you to check them out and play with them!</p>
      
     <h2>In
      Conclusion </h2>
      <p>you now know enough to skim through and understand any part of
      an HTML code. We request you to go ahead and try skimming through the
      source code of any website (you&apos;ll find some tags you don&apos;t
      know, but that&apos;s how you learn!). Oh, and welcome to the world of web
      development. With HTML under your belt, your next stop should be making
      your page look beautiful using CSS.</p>
